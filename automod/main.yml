        Due to the nature of this topic and the likelihood of brigading as evidenced by previous posts, this post has been tagged as controversial. As a controversial thread,
        
        * All participating commentators must have significant /r/Toronto histories in order to prevent brigading. Any violators will receive a ban without warning.
        
        * Any rule-breaking actions by /r/Toronto regulars will be punished with increased severity (i.e. 30 day ban instead of a 7 day ban, etc.).
        
        Negative opinions are fine! Blatant racism and pushing racist agendas are not! Please be careful to follow Rules 2 and 3 and engage in polite, respectful dialogue.
    modmail: Post tagged as controversial, please verify.
